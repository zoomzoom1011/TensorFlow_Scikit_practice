# tensorflow-sklearn

These are some examples I use for simple neural network, random forest and neural style transfer. 

Neural netwrok here use the pipeline to deal with the preprocess, and make the prediction for the recogin

The way to run tensorflow is (tensor + flow): 
1. Create Tensors (variables)
2. Write operations between these Tensors.
3. Initialize your Tensors.
4. Create a Session.
5. Run the Session which contains the operation 

random forest is used for prediction and factor importance
