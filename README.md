# TensorFlow sklearn practice

These are some examples I use for simple neural network, random forest. 

Neural netwrok here use the pipeline to deal with the preprocess, and make the prediction

The way to run tensorflow is (tensor + flow): 
1. Create Tensors (variables)
2. Write operations between these Tensors.
3. Initialize your Tensors.
4. Create a Session.
5. Run the Session which contains the operation 

Random forest is used for prediction and factor importance
